# Changelog

## Next version

- Put your changes here...

## 1.0.1

- Renamed package from `express-php-view-engine` to `php`. Thanks to Elmer Bulthuis for transferring the package name.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 1.0.0

- Initial version of superseding project.
  - `express-php-view-engine` notably does not attempt to finish the work of the old `php` module. Instead it allows the native PHP parser to execute as a child process within Express applications.

## 0.0.1

- Initial version of original project.
  - Originally the `php` module on npm was used by a separate project that attempted to implement a PHP parser in JavaScript for Node.js, but was never finished. One work in progress version was published, then the project remained stale for 8 years.
